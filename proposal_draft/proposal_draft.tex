The aim of our project is to train a Reinforcement Learning agent which is able to carry out movements with a robot arm from a starting point to a goal point through challenging environment. Under challenging environment we understand an environment with obstacles in the manipulation space with which the robot arm must not collide during movement. The guidelines along which we will present our final project proposition are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We are going to train the robot arm via simulation.
	\item We are mostly going to incorporate the ideas of Neural Motion Planning \cite{NMP}, Hindsight Experience Replay \cite{HER} and Generalized Hindsight Experience Replay \cite{GHER}.
	\item The final goal is to evaluate the performance of the trained agent in previously unseen environments.
\end{itemize}
